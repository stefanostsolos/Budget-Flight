Find the cheapest flights to your dream destinations. We are using kayak.com data to select the lowest cost tickets. User is prompted to input his origin, the number of desired destinations, the destinations, the number of preferable departure dates, the departure dates and the length of stay. Results are visualized as a heatmap, so it's clear which flights are more affordable, when multiple destinations and/or departure dates are selected.
